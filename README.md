### Optimizing for Metaversal Deployment

With R18, the all-new 8th Wall Engine features Metaversal Deployment, enabling you to create WebAR experiences once and deploy them to smartphones, tablets, computers and both AR and VR headsets. This project has a few platform-specific customizations:

In **body.html**, we add the `"allowedDevices: any"` parameter to our `xrweb` component in `<a-scene>`
which ensures the project opens on all platforms, including desktop. Environment parameters
have been customized to generate an open desert space.

### About World Tracking

Built entirely using standards-compliant JavaScript and WebGL, 8th Wallâ€™s Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) engine is hyper-optimized for real-time AR on mobile browsers. Features include
Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF), Lighting estimation, instant surface detection and responsive scale.

The Y position of the camera at start effectively determines the scale of virtual content on a surface
(e.g. smaller y, bigger content). This can be reset at any time by calling
[`recenter()`](https://www.8thwall.com/docs/web/#recenter).

The camera should NOT be at a height (Y) of zero. It must be set to a non-zero value.
